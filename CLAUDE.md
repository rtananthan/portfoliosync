- ✅ Deployed to AWS and live

### Next Priorities (Phases 2-3)
1. **Phase 2: Enhanced Dashboard Analytics** (IN PROGRESS)

## Key Implementation Details

### Benchmarking System
- Compares portfolio against ASX 200 (^AXJO), S&P 500 (^GSPC), etc.
- Calculates outperformance across multiple time periods
- Uses mock data for development (ready for real API integration)
- Displays results in dashboard widget and dedicated page

### Data Export System
- Supports CSV, JSON, Excel formats
- Individual asset exports or complete portfolio
- Includes summary reports with performance metrics
- Handles Australian property fields and tax calculations

### Validation System  
- Real-time form validation with visual feedback
- Common validation rules for stocks, ETFs, properties
- Input sanitization to prevent XSS
- Error aggregation and user-friendly messaging

### Error Handling
- Centralized error parsing with user-friendly messages
- Network error detection and retry mechanisms
- Partial failure handling (some APIs fail, others succeed)
- Visual error components with action buttons

## Competitive Analysis vs Kubera/Sharesight
**Our Advantages:**
- Australian property focus with detailed metrics
- Clean, simple interface  
- Local data control, no subscription lock-in
- Strong benchmarking (now matches competitors)

**Still Missing (Future phases):**
- Advanced tax reporting (Sharesight's strength)
- Broker integration (both competitors have this)
- Multi-asset expansion (crypto, international)
- Portfolio optimization tools

## Development Context
- Working on matching Kubera/Sharesight features
- Focus on Australian market compliance
- Prioritizing high-impact, low-effort improvements
- Building toward broker integration eventually
- Currently implementing Phase 2: Enhanced dashboard analytics

## Last Session Progress
- Implemented complete performance benchmarking system
- Added BenchmarkWidget to main dashboard  
- Created dedicated /benchmark page with detailed analysis
- Successfully deployed to AWS and CloudFront
- Ready to start Phase 2: Enhanced Dashboard Analytics

## Commands for Next Session
```bash
cd /Users/ananthan/Projects/investment-tracker/frontend
npm run build  # Test build
npm run dev    # Local development
